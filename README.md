This repository contains source code and data implementing some simple
exploratory analyses of the GTEx gene expression data.

The [data](data) folder contains data files that were downloaded from
the [GTEx Portal][gtex-portal].

These materials were developed by [Peter Carbonetto](peter) at
the [University of Chicago](uchicago).
